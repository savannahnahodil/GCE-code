Public JINA Python Chemical Evolution Environment

This repository contains a series of multi-zone galactic chemical evolution codes written in Python 3. It represents an extension of the NuPyCEE package (see also our website) and the end point of the JINA-NuGrid chemical evolution pipeline (see Côté et al. 2017a).

OMEGA+ (Côté et al. 2018):

2-zone model including a galactic (star-forming gas) and circumgalactic (hot gas reservoir) components.
Star formation based on the balance between gas inflows and stellar feedback.
Chemical evolution of the galactic component calculated by OMEGA (One-zone Model for the Evolution of GAlaxies, Côté et al. 2017b), a code part of NuPyCEE.

GAMMA (Galaxy Assembly with Merger-trees for Modeling Abundances, Côté et al. 2018):

Semi-analytic code following the mass assembly of galaxies based on merger trees provided by cosmological simulations.
Evolution of each building-block galaxy (each branch of the merger tree) calculated by OMEGA+, a code part of JINAPyCEE.
Please see the caga open-source analysis codes to use GAMMA on top of Caterpillar merger trees (see Griffen et al. 2016).

       
Requirement:

NuPyCEE to access the chemical evolution functions.
ytree if you want to read consistent-tree files for GAMMA.
Userguides: See the DOC directory.

If you have questions, comments, or want to report a problem, please contact Benoit Côté (bcote@uvic.ca, benoit.cote@csfk.mta.hu).

Installation Instructions:
Go in the directory with a terminal where the NuPyCEE directory is located (not in the NuPyCEE directory itself).
Clone the GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/becot85/JINAPyCEE.git
From the same directory which contains the cloned NuPyCEE and JINAPyCEE directories, you can import the codes in Python mode by typing:
from JINAPyCEE import omega_plus
from JINAPyCEE import gamma
